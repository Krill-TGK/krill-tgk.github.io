        <h1><strong>The Freaktastic four</strong></h1>
<p> In order to embrace goonology, I must conversate with the Freakiest Gooners I know. <br>
    The Freaktastic four.
<ul>
   <li> Mr. Freaktastic</li> 
   <li> The Infreakable Woman</li>
    <li> The Freak</li>
    <li> The Human Freak</li>
</ul>
They have the most knowledge on anything goonology related, if We want to suceed in Goonshoe's quest we need them.

 <p> Fortuanatly I have One of them on speed dial. "Sus-An, hello i needd to talk to you and the freaks about something important." 
   <br> The Axter Building. Homebase of the Freaktastic four. Whilst talking to Mr. Freaktastic I noticed that <em>Steven</em>, a seperate person 
   inhabiting the same body as me, started to feel uneasy.
   "After that you take the tis- Hey are you listing?" 
   <br> "Yes. Sorry Read, its been been pleasureable speaking with you but I think We're done here."<br>
Ugh, that was useless, I am Goon Knight, I am Jake Lockley, And I don't need to a crash course on the Goon. 
<br>" Wait! You didn't finish! oh, Marc. If one Goons without respect, even if they are The Goon Knight, they are no better than a Gooner."
<br><strong>Off to destroy the Gooners.</strong>
