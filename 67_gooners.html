        <p>Ugh, Look at them Steven. All those nasty Freaks practically drooling at just the sight of a costume.
          <br> *british* Um, Marc, was that really the best way to leave the four?
          <br> What do you mean?
          <br> Well, the four have always been long time collaborators in helping us take out Gooners. 
          And I suppose I feel we should have showed them a bit more respect. 
          <br> *rough* No matter who they are Steven, the more respectful you are to people the more they will take from you.
          <br> *british* But Jake! That's are horrible way to- 
          <br>
          <strong> AAAAHHHH, STOP!!!</strong>
          <br> *normal* Gooners.
          <h2>Proof Of What We Are</h2>
        "Oh wow! What a nice costume you have on pwincess." The vile lead of the local gooner gang says.
        <br> "<strong> Hands off Gooner!</strong> Shes not gonna letchu date her lil bro."
        <br> "You're no kitten. Get him Boyz!"
      <br> "Bring it on." 
      <br> *big ol fight breaks out* 
      <br> Steven punches one gooner into another before following up with a drop kick. 
      Marc kicks another in the face before backflipping off his face into an elbow slam to a charging gooner.
      Lastly Jake repeatedly pounds a gooner's face in before dragging him to the boss.
     <br> " *rough* So, got any other sorry excuses for grunts I should dominate or did you come with only five friends."
      The Gooner lead pulls out a knife and aims it at Goon Knight, trembling the whole time.
      <br> "Isn't that cute? *normal* Mine's bigger."
      Goon Knight whips out his Long Goon Saber and charges in for the kill.
      <br> "<b>Mommy C!</b> Do Somethi-"
      <br> "Mommy C? could it be? <em> <b> Mommy Cela?!</b></em>"
      Goon knight says ghastly as his Saber drips the Pale color of Gooner blood.
      "So, Goonshoe still has his avatars running around destroying my minions as payback for me leaving him huh?"
      The girl twisted and turned revaling her true apperance. 
     <br> "How Amusing. Now kneel before Cela! Ruler of Gooners! And The Goddess Of Goon."
      "Goddess of Goon? woulnd't that mean..."
      "hmph yes. Goonshoe was a diffrent being back then, now he advocates for gooning whilst being too scared of Gooners."
      <br> "No matter! You are nothing but a goonette. The worst of the Goonettes. It is my duty to slay you!"
      Goon Knight rushes in Saber already swinging. As Mommy C's false form disintegrates.
     <br> An echoing laugh fills the air. 
        </p>

        <p><b> "Goonettes? Is Goonshoe really creating masochists now?"</b></p>

        <p> what the hecky. Goonshoe what haven't you told us? maybe <em> she</em> knows something.
        I think she works down in Milkshire now. <br>
      Good. I can smash two objectives with one session. </p>
