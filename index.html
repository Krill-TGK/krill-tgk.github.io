      <h1> <strong>I am Goon  Knight, avatar of Goonshoe, The God of The Goon</strong> </h1>
        <p> on a dark stormy night, evil lurks. around every corner a darkness spreads. Only one paladin of justice can subdue it. <em> Goon Knight</em></p>
      <h2> THE GOON HAUNTS YOU!!!</h2>
       <p> The night is unforgiving. The people of the night, even more so.
         It is my job, my divine duty, to stop these freaks.<br>
       </br> For I am goongence incarnate, I am <em> <strong> The Goon Knight.</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p> The <b>Goon</b> is saught by many, yet they fail to understand the purpose of Goon.
            That is why I must stop them. <em>A Gooner aproaches... </em>
            "Stop! you have angered <b><em>Goonshoe</em></b>, now you will face divine goongeance."
            He's armed, I'd better make this quick, but it wainstreeon't be painless.
            <b><br> Face Judgement Gooner! The Goon Haunts you! *eviscerates the gooner* </br></b>
            "May your impure soul bask in the holy radiance of Goon and rest."
            I don't like what I have to do, but I know my duty and I know its what I must do.
        </p>
          <h3> Doubt in the purpose... </h3>
          <p> <b> Halloween, 2025,</b> Tonight is going to be big. It is the only night of the year where gooners have an excuse to commit their atrocitites in public.
          <em> <b> Goonshoe</em> will </b> be proud.
         </p>
          <p> "Hey drama queen! Eyes up!" ugh, The Spider. He may be a competent fighter but hes so godawful anno-</p>
         <p>*in british accent* would you mind keeping<em> Our</em> mind focused, " Ah yes pe- erm i mean spider man! we were just about to say that to you as well"</p>
         <p><b> Arise My Son. You are needed.</b></p>
         <p> ugh the Goon Mindspace, what a drag.
          " I can hear your thoughts y'know Marc." The ghostly bird god spoke.
          "Goonshoe, You called upon me, why?"
          "I have divine errends for you. Will you accept?"\
          He said as if I have a choice. "What are they?"<br>
